# MusicPro

This is my academic project where I have built an android application with the following features:

1. Insertion of record about venues (with input validation)
2. Display list of venues using RecyclerView
3. Send email using Intent
4. Fetch the details of the weeks top-rated venue from a remote web server using HTTP
5. Implemented threading with AsyncTask
6. Add a new activity that displays Google Maps with a marker

Here's are few screenshot of project:
